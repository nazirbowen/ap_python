# 1. In your own words, describe what a for loop is?

for loops are used for executing a set of statements over a sequence.

# 2. What is the difference between a FOR loop and a WHILE loop?
# Provide two (2) examples of each. 

 for loop is used when the number of iterations is known, whereas execution is done in a while loop until the statement in the program is proved wrong

# 3. Create a FOR loop that will go through a list of names 
# and print all the names that start with the letter "R".

Rnames = ["Rebecca , Robert , Rose "]
for x in Rnames:
 print (x)
names=['Michael','Rebecca','William','Kareem','Robert','Rose','Jason']
