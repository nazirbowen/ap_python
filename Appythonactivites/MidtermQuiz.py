# MID TERM QUIZ 

# 1. Describe what a computer program is and what does it do. 
A Computer Program is a set of instructions that a computer can execute 
in order to perform a specific task or achieve a particular goal.

 computer program can automate certain processes and can be reused and modifiyed .

# 2. Describe what complexitity and abstraction are, then provide an example
# of complexity in the real world and how we apply abstraction to that thing (you example must be original and cannot be an example
# used in our lecture slides ie car, grocery store, etc.). 
  Complexity is the measure of how resource intensive a program can be. 
Time, memory, power, and other computation resources are taken into consideration 
when assessing complexity.
    
    Abstraction is process of simplifying or breaking down code.  
abstraction is used to break down the complexity.


# 3. What is Syntax in Python and why is it important to write proper syntax?
Syntax and Data types are the way a computer reads and understands our programs. 
It in essence is the rules and format we use to write our program.


# 4. What is a function, and why do we wrap our code inside of functions?
A function is a block of code that only runs when it is called
a function can return data as a result.


# 5. Name and describe the three (3) naming conventions for variables in python? Then provide three (3) name rules for Python
# variables. 
Camel Case is the second word of a variable name, and every word after starts with a capital 
pascal case every word including the first word, starts with a capital letter.
snake case is a variable naming convention where each word is in lower case and underscores 
# 6. What will be the output of the print functons when this code is ran, explain why
name = 'Bill'
student = name
name = 'Walter'
student= 'Richard'

print(name)
print(student)
Walter and Richard will print because theyre the final command or function
# 7. Describe the difference between each of the following assignment operators:
# = 
# ==  
# !=
The = checks if the vaules are equal to eachother 
The == checks if the values of two operands are equal or not. 
The != checks if the vaules are not equal to eachother 

# 8. What type of data can be stored in a python list?
Floats, bools, int etc
# 9. Create a function that will take in a word provided by a user and then output that word back to the user but in reverse. 
input()
print()

# 10. Create three (3) seperate functions that will do addition, subtraction, and multiplication respectively. 
# each of these functions should take two (2) arguments. When the user passes these arguments into the function, they will be
# calculated together and return the output in your terminal. 


# 11. What is the difference between a function argument and a function parameter. 
Parameters are the placeholders in our functions definitions. 
Arguments are the actual data we pass into our function when we call it. 

# 12. You have been hired by a software company and your first assignment is to develop a password authenticator program. 
# the goal of your program is to check a user's password and make sure it meets the company's password requirements. 
# the company has provided you with the following requirements for the passcode program:
# a. the passcode must NOT contain any numbers
# b. the passcode must NOT contain any capital letters
# c. the passcode can NOT be any longer than five (5) characters
# d. the passcode can NOT shorter the three (3) characters
# e. the user should be able to enter their password and if it meets the requirements, should print a message saying that 
# their password was created successfully, and if it was not, should send back a message with one of the following issues. 

# 13. When you run your code and see typeError in your terminal, what does that typically mean and how would you try to solve
# the issue?
When you run your code in and get typeerror that usally means that something you typed is wrong 
with the code and that you should check to fix it.

# 14. When you run your code and see indentError in your terminal, what does that typically mean and how would you try to solve 
# the issue?
When you run your code and get an indenterror that means you indented wrong or was supposed to indent

# 15. Create a while loop that check a user's password. If they enter the password correct, they will get a message saying 
# that the password was entered successfully. If they enter the password incorrectly, it will tell the user to try again. 
# The user should only have three (3) attempts to get the password correct. If they enter the password incorrect on the fourth 
# attempt, a message should appear telling them that have been locked out and need to talk to the administrator. 


# 16. Which item is at index 5
giftShopping=['xbox','sneakers','necklace','clothing','laptop','gift card']

# 17. Create a for loop that will print ONLY the even numbers within the range of the variable provided below.
# HINT: You will need to use the range() function. 
upToNumber = 30

# 18. Create a function that uses a conditional statement that checks if a person qualifies for a raise on their salary. 
# The user should be able to enter their name, their salary (how much money they make in an entire year), and how long they have
# worked at the company. If the user has been working at the company longer than four (4) years, they will get a 15% raise. 
# Your program should be able to calculate what their salary is with the 15% increase. If the user qualifies, your program
# should return the a message congratulating the user by name, and telling them what their new salary is with the 15%
# increase (this must be the actual number). If they do not qualify inform the user that unfortunately they do not qualify. 

# 19. Create a function that checks which value is greater than the other. Your function should take two (2) integer parameters. 
# and should evaluate which number is larger. Your function should then print the largest number. 

# 20. Create a while loop function that will add gift items to a list. Your function should ask the user to enter an item name. 
# The item name should then be added to a list variable called gift_bag. Your gift bag should have a limit of six (6) items. 
# Once your gift bag hits its limit of six (6) items your program should print a message saying 
# that the gift bag is full and print the list of items in the gift bag.
