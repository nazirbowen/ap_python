# 1. What is the difference between 
# a parameter and an argument in a python function
Parameters are the placeholders in our functions definitions. 
Arguments are the actual data we pass into our function when we call it. 

# 2. In your own words, describe what 
# a conditional statement (if/else) is 
A conditional statment is a true or false almost like a boolean

# 3. write a simple conditional state using a comparision operator(greater than, less than, etc. )
a = 2
b = 200
if b > a:
print("b is greater than a") 

# 3. Write a conditional statement for food in the refridgerator.
# your conditional statement should be wrapped in a function that takes one (1)
# parameter. The data type for this parameter should be true or false. 
# your function should have a line of code that asks the user if there is food in the refridgerator.
# If there is food in the refridgerator, print time to cook. If there is 
# NOT food in the fridge, print time to shop. 
# When you call your function there should be an argument that accepts 
# a boolean. 
def def FoodInRefridgerator():
    
    if FoodInRefridgerator > NoFoodInRefridgerator:
        print('you have food')
    else:
        print('you dont have food.')
FoodInRefridgerator():

# 4. Create a function that checks the inventory of cereal for a store. 
# your function should parameter should accept an integer. In your function
# use a conditional statement to determine if you need to order more cereal.
# If there is more than 10 boxes, print "inventory full", else if there are less than 
# 10 boxes print "we need to order more cereal".
